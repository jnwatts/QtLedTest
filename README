	This is a little program I threw together to help evaluate different OLED
	displays and GUI layouts for them. Internally, it's comprised of 1 external
	widget and 3 of my own:

	QLedMatrix: I briefly contemplated writing my own widget to emulate the
	actual LED display, but thanks to a quick search I found one already written
	for me. Actually, I think the author, Pierre-Etienne Messier, did an amazing
	job! :-)

	SSD1306: A simulation of the OLED controller by the same name. This wraps
	Pierre-Etienne's QLedMatrix with the same interface as the real thing (see
	lines 46 thru 48). Unlike the real thing, you can resize the display
	dynamically at run-time. In the future I'd actually extend this model to
	include various timing and output features of the real controller, such as
	updating the pixels at the actual "clock-rate" and generating the "frame"
	signal for synchronizing writes to the device. (Hrm... I suppose I could
	even simulate the clock-rate of the SPI bus... hehe ;-)

	Graphics: Not wanting to draw just a single static bitmap to the display, I
	chose to implement a very basic (and very inefficient) graphics library. The
	library works directly on the same image format as the SSD1306's internal
	GDDRAM: each byte of a page corresponds to the 8 bit rows at that particular
	column. I implement the minimum set of operations I felt I would need to
	make a useful UI: Fill, Rect, Line, Arc and a convenience "Tab" function.

	Font_info: Shortly after completing the Tab function, I realized my UI would
	useless without some kind of font support ;-) I used Font Builder to convert
	some free fonts into rasterized images. This also generates an XML
	description file that lists all of the important metrics for each character
	of the font. I wrote a quick program to convert the png and XML of each font
	into a C source/header pair (encoded in the same format the graphics lib
	works on).
